Hi there.

We currently are just too lazy to write a proper documentation.

So, I'll give a short introduction:

a) put satmd_botnet/ within eggdrop's path (no .. or . allowed)

b) copy settings.tcl.example to settings.tcl and put in sane values ;D

c) only load modules that you HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD. You cannot blame me if it doesn't work :P

d) include PATH/satmd_botnet/init.tcl
